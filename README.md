I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits like using Git, drinking coffee, and never giving up on a bug. I code, I break things, and sometimes I fix them too. When I'm not coding, I'm probably cruising or trying out new pizza places. Let's make some cool things together!
